# my-website
Welcome to my personal website that I built using HTML/CSS, Javascript, and Amazon AWS to host. 
This is a simple project that I decided to make to start learning the functionalities of 
front-end development and was also a great opportunity to showcase some of my previous 
experiences. You can access the website through: http://asw322-personal.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
This project is still under development. I am hopping to implement new features and possibly acquire a 
public domain to host my website such that we can replace this aws link.
